### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Ria, a passionate artist, anything tech enthusiast, and aspiring web and app developer!

I am a 19-year old Computer Science student from [Malayan Colleges Mindanao](https://mcm.edu.ph). I am a freelance digital illustrator and an enthusiast in UI/UX research & design. As an artist, I have also competed in few regional art competitions.

As a tech enthusiast, I love everything software-related and *Fun fact: I am an Apple and Google fangirl!*
