# Hello there! 👋

I am Ria, a 21-year old Computer Science student from [Mapúa Malayan Colleges Mindanao](https://mcm.edu.ph) and a UX/Web Designer at [Xugar](https://xugar.com.au/). I am an artist and anything tech enthusiast! I enjoy learning about human-centered design and employing them in my UI/UX career. I am also a tech volunteer who is currently participating in the following tech communities:

- Former GDSC Lead of [GDSC Mapúa-MCM](https://gdsc.community.dev/mapua-malayan-colleges-mindanao/)

- Core Volunteer at [GDG Davao](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-davao/)

I aspire to become an inspiring figure to women of my age and encourage them to explore a career in technology.

I am a freelance digital illustrator and an enthusiast in UI/UX research & design. As an artist, I have also competed in few regional art competitions. As a tech enthusiast, I love everything software-related— fun fact, I am an Apple and Google fangirl!
